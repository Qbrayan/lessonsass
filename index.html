The prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.Chickens farmed for meat are called broiler chickens.</p></div>
      <div ><div id="t2">Beef</div><p >Beef is first divided into primal cuts, pieces of meat initially separated from the carcass during butchering. These are basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut. The term "primal cut" is quite different from "prime cut", used to characterize cuts considered to be of higher quality.</p></div>
